## In short

From the documentation:

>`NW.UnivariateForecasting` is a library to perform univariate forecasting tasks on the values you provide. 

>`NW.UnivariateForecastingClient` (`unifor.exe`) is the command-line client for the `NW.UnivariateForecasting` library.

## Download the source code

I assume you are on `Windows`, but the library should compile without issues on `Linux` as well. Please:

1. Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win);
2. Open `Windows Powershell` (or `Windows Terminal` or similar) and type:

```powershell
PS C:\> mkdir NW.UnivariateForecasting
PS C:\> cd .\NW.UnivariateForecasting\
PS C:\NW.UnivariateForecasting> git clone https://github.com/numbworks/NW.UnivariateForecasting.git
```

3. Open `NW.UnivariateForecasting.sln` with `Visual Studio` or other IDE;
4. Done!

## Download the library's binary package

If you are a .NET developer and you want to use the library from within your projects, the binary packages are available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NW.UnivariateForecasting/).

## Download the client's binary package

If you are an non-developer user, you can download the client from the [Releases](https://github.com/numbworks/NW.UnivariateForecasting/releases) page on Github.
