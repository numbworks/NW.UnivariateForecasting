## In Short

**NW.UnivariateForecasting** is a **.NET Standard 2.0** library written in **C#** to perform Univariate Forecasting on your own values. 

From the documentation:

> *Time Series Forecasting* is a *machine learning* technique that aims to predict the next values in a time series when a subset of subsequent timestamped values is provided ("*sliding window*"). There is no other information available than the timestamp and the value itself.

> For example, given the last six months of "*Total Monthly Sales USD*" of your company, you would like the machine to predict the amounts for the next x months.

> *Time Series Forecasting* is divided in *Univariate* and *Multivariate*. 
The first one can predict only one step ahead, while the second one can predict multiple steps ahead.

> As its name states, this library implements the univariate approach. 

**NW.UnivariateForecasting** is available as source code and as NuGet package.
